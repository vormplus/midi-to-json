		{
		  "octave": 2,
		  "noteName": "C2",
		  "tick": 0,
		  "velocity": 100,
		  "noteNumber": 36,

		},
		{
		  "octave": 3,

### babylonjs_music_video

This folder contains a small WebGL Music Video created with BabylonJS. The converted MIDI is used to sync some basic animations to the audio that is playing in the background. Youâ€™ll need to run a web server in this directory for everything to work. Open a terminal, navigate to this directory, and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to start a basic web server.
